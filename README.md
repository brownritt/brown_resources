# Some Brown Quantitative Resources

## Carney Institute for Brain Science

- Any Carney affiliated researcher can contact Jason Ritt (jason_ritt@brown.edu), Carney's Scientific Director of Quantitative Neuroscience, for consultation on questions of quantitative methodology (e.g., research design, data analysis, coding, high performance computing).
- Centers and cores in the Carney Institute
